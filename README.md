Update the Classical Chollet's Deep Learning with Python 

Fran√ßois Chollet wrote Deep Learning with Python using both the Python language and the powerful 
Keras library to build intuitive explanations and practical examples. However, some of the notebook 
code of lines are obsolete and tools are deprecated after the release of new dev environments such 
as Keras 2.4, TensorFlow 2.3, imageio, etc. I am dedicated to correct the code by rewriting some of 
notebook lines and more importantly turn the notebook code into the easy-to-run python code. 

Although Kears has been gradullay integrated into the TensorFlow environment, some classical programs 
(especially the teaching programs) keep still no changed. It raises the challenges to the beginners
who want the easy-to-read solutions. In addition, much more annoying errors emerges from anywhere 
while readers run the obsolete Notebook programs. Therefore, the python script would be a better 
complementary alternative to the Notebook codes. 

After the above-mentioned improvement, beginners and readers have an opportunity to continue learn 
the best practice initiated by the original author. You will explore challenging concepts and practice 
with applications in Computer Vision, NLP and Generative Models. By the time you finish, you will have 
the knowledge and hands-on skills to apply deep learning in your own projects.
