Update the Classical Chollet's Deep Learning with Python 

Fran√ßois Chollet wrote Deep Learning with Python using both the Python language and the powerful 
Keras library to build intuitive explanations and practical examples. However, some of the notebook 
code of lines are obsolete and tools are deprecated after the release of new dev environments such 
as Keras 2.4, TensorFlow 2.3, imageio, etc. 

1. Adapt to the New Dev Environment

Although Kears has been gradullay integrated into the TensorFlow environment, some classical programs 
(especially the teaching programs) keep still no changed. It raises the challenges to the beginners
who want the easy-to-read solutions. All of the programs are tested to adapt to both Keas 2.4.3 and 
TF 2.3.1. 

2. Correct Code Errors

Much more annoying errors emerges from anywhere while readers run the obsolete Notebook programs. 
Therefore, the python script would be a better complementary alternative to the Notebook codes. I am 
dedicated to correct the code by rewriting some of notebook lines and 

3.Turn the Notebook to Python programs

More importantly, I turn the notebook code into the easy-to-run python code. After the improvement, 
beginners and readers have an opportunity to continue learn the best practice initiated by the original 
author. 

Conclusion

You will explore challenging concepts and practice with applications in Computer Vision, NLP and Generative 
Models. By the time you finish, you will have the knowledge and hands-on skills to apply deep learning in 
your own projects.
