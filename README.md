Update the Classical Chollet's Deep Learning with Python 

Fran√ßois Chollet wrote Deep Learning with Python using both the Python language and the powerful 
Keras library to build intuitive explanations and practical examples. However, some of the notebook 
code of lines are obsolete and tools are deprecated aftert the release of new dev environments such 
as Keras 2.4,TensorFlow 2.3, imageio, etc. I am dedicated to correct the code by rewriting some of 
notebook lines and more importantly turn the notebook code into the easy-to-run python code. 

After the above-mentioned improvement, beginners and readers have an opportunity to continue learn 
the best practice initiated by the original author. You will explore challenging concepts and practice 
with applications in Computer Vision, NLP and Generative Models. By the time you finish, you will have 
the knowledge and hands-on skills to apply deep learning in your own projects.
