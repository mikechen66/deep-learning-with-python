    "## A schematic GAN implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we explain how to implement a GAN in Keras, in its barest form -- since GANs are quite advanced, diving deeply into the \n",
    "technical details would be out of scope for us. Our specific implementation will be a deep convolutional GAN, or DCGAN: a GAN where the \n",
    "generator and discriminator are deep convnets. In particular, it leverages a `Conv2DTranspose` layer for image upsampling in the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train our GAN on images from CIFAR10, a dataset of 50,000 32x32 RGB images belong to 10 classes (5,000 images per class). To make \n",
    "things even easier, we will only use images belonging to the class \"frog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, our GAN looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `generator` network maps vectors of shape `(latent_dim,)` to images of shape `(32, 32, 3)`.\n",
    "* A `discriminator` network maps images of shape (32, 32, 3) to a binary score estimating the probability that the image is real.\n",
    "* A `gan` network chains the generator and the discriminator together: `gan(x) = discriminator(generator(x))`. Thus this `gan` network maps \n",
    "latent space vectors to the discriminator's assessment of the realism of these latent vectors as decoded by the generator.\n",
    "* We train the discriminator using examples of real and fake images along with \"real\"/\"fake\" labels, as we would train any regular image \n",
    "classification model.\n",
    "* To train the generator, we use the gradients of the generator's weights with regard to the loss of the `gan` model. This means that, at \n",
    "every step, we move the weights of the generator in a direction that will make the discriminator more likely to classify as \"real\" the \n",
    "images decoded by the generator. I.e. we train the generator to fool the discriminator."

    "## A bag of tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Training GANs and tuning GAN implementations is notoriously difficult. There are a number of known \"tricks\" that one should keep in mind. \n",
    "Like most things in deep learning, it is more alchemy than science: these tricks are really just heuristics, not theory-backed guidelines. \n",
    "They are backed by some level of intuitive understanding of the phenomenon at hand, and they are known to work well empirically, albeit not \n",
    "necessarily in every context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few of the tricks that we leverage in our own implementation of a GAN generator and discriminator below. It is not an exhaustive \n",
    "list of GAN-related tricks; you will find many more across the GAN literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use `tanh` as the last activation in the generator, instead of `sigmoid`, which would be more commonly found in other types of models.\n",
    "* We sample points from the latent space using a _normal distribution_ (Gaussian distribution), not a uniform distribution.\n",
    "* Stochasticity is good to induce robustness. Since GAN training results in a dynamic equilibrium, GANs are likely to get \"stuck\" in all sorts of ways. \n",
    "Introducing randomness during training helps prevent this. We introduce randomness in two ways: 1) we use dropout in the discriminator, 2) \n",
    "we add some random noise to the labels for the discriminator.\n",
    "* Sparse gradients can hinder GAN training. In deep learning, sparsity is often a desirable property, but not in GANs. There are two things \n",
    "that can induce gradient sparsity: 1) max pooling operations, 2) ReLU activations. Instead of max pooling, we recommend using strided \n",
    "convolutions for downsampling, and we recommend using a `LeakyReLU` layer instead of a ReLU activation. It is similar to ReLU but it \n",
    "relaxes sparsity constraints by allowing small negative activation values.\n",
    "* In generated images, it is common to see \"checkerboard artifacts\" caused by unequal coverage of the pixel space in the generator. To fix \n",
    "this, we use a kernel size that is divisible by the stride size, whenever we use a strided `Conv2DTranpose` or `Conv2D` in both the \n",
    "generator and discriminator."
